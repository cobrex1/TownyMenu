#   COLOR CODES
#   - Default is MINIMESSAGE, but HEX and Legacy ('&') are also supported in this mode.
#   - If you keep to LAEGACY mode, do not use MINIMESSAGE format
#   - For usage, see http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Formatting_codes
#   - When you use them, place quotes around the message like this: "&a&lBack"
#   - To use MINIMESAGE, use <bold><green> or <gradient:red:green> for example.
#   - To use HEX colors, use #123456 or #123456 syntax eg: "Hello #123456world."
